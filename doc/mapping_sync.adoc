Afterglow is designed to work with MIDI controllers and DJ equipment.
You can bind physical controller elements to trigger cues and adjust
show variables, and sync the BPM of the show master metronome to MIDI
clock pulses from a DJ controller or mixer. (Although if you have
professional Pioneer gear, you are better off syncing the metronome to
the Pro DJ Link via an Ethernet cable.)

NOTE: These examples assume you are in a Clojure REPL with Afterglow loaded,
in the namespace `afterglow.examples`. This is the default namespace you
get if you check out the project and run `lein repl`. The sample show is
assumed to be running; if not, `(show/start!)`

== Mapping Cues to a Controller

Although the most convenient and powerful way of running cues with
Afterglow is to use a large grid controller with color feedback, like
the Ableton Push which can mirror the cue grid of the web interface,
you can still accomplish a great deal with a simple controller with a
few buttons. You will still want to start by creating the cues in the
show cue grid, not only so you can see and manipulate them with the
web interface, but also because that is how they can be mapped to MIDI
controllers. (The Push mapping is described in detail
<<mapping_sync#using-ableton-push,below>>.)

First you need to identify the MIDI messages that the controller sends
when you press and release the interface element you want to assign
the cue. Afterglow can help with that too, as described
<<finding-mapping-details,below>>. Once you have the cue created and
the control identified, you can create the mapping using
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.show.html#var-add-midi-control-to-cue-mapping[afterglow.show/add-midi-control-to-cue-mapping], like:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/add-midi-control-to-cue-mapping "nano" 0 :control 46 0 6)
----

This would cause Afterglow to start or stop the cue at grid position
(0, 6) when a pad on the device named "nano" is pressed and sends a
MIDI control change message on control number 46.

If the controller has LEDs associated with the controls, and you can
configure it so that its LEDs are in external control mode, Afterglow
will even give you feedback about when the cue is running, by lighting
up the pad or button when the cue starts (whether or not you started
it using this controller), and darkening it when the cue ends.

== Mapping a Control to a Variable

You can also tie an encoder or fader on a MIDI control surface to a
show variable, so that turning the encoder or sliding the fader
changes the value of the variable. If you have set up cues to look at
that variable, through
https://github.com/brunchboy/afterglow/blob/master/doc/cues.adoc#cue-variables[cue-specific
variable bindings], the control surface can then vary the look of the
effect created by the cue, both before the cue is launched, and while
it is running.

Here is a lower-level example of how I can have a knob on one of my
simple MIDI controllers set the hue of all the lights. It shows up
with a MIDI port name of `SLIDER/KNOB`, and its first rotary
controller is control 16 on channel 0. I can map that to set a show
variable `knob-1` to the values 0-360 (the legal hue values):

[source,clojure]
----
(show/add-midi-control-to-var-mapping
  "Slider" 0 16 :knob-1 :max 360)
----

Then I can create a global color effect based on that variable:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/add-effect! :color (global-color-effect
  (params/build-color-param :s 100 :l 50 :h :knob-1)))
----

It is also possible to perform arbitrary transformation of the MIDI
value before storing it into the show variable, by passing
`add-midi-control-to-var-mapping` a transformation function using the
optional keyword argument `:transform-fn`. The function you supply
will called with the MIDI value (already scaled, if you passed a value
with `:min` or `:max`), and whatever it returns will be stored in the
variable. Your function can contain whatever logic it needs, and does
not even need to return a number. As a simple example, suppose you
want to set up a `:beat-ratio` variable for configuring oscillators,
and you want it to have the value 1, 2, 4, or 8, depending on how far
a fader is raised. Since those are all powers of two, you could
implement the varible binding like this:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/add-midi-control-to-var-mapping
  "SLIDER" 0 1 :beat-ratio :max 3
  :transform-fn (fn [v] (Math/pow 2 (Math/round v))))
----

NOTE: This intercepts any MIDI control-change messages for the device
whose name contains "SLIDER", on channel 0, controller number 1. It
scales the incoming control value to the range 0 through 3, then calls
a custom function which rounds the scaled value to the nearest
integer, and raises 2 to that power. The result gets stored into the
show variable `:beat-ratio`.

== Finding Mapping Details

In the all-too likely event you don’t have all your MIDI port names and
control channel and note numbers memorized, Afterglow can help. Just
run...

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.midi/identify-mapping)
----

...then twiddle the knob, slide the fader, or press the button you
wish to map. Afterglow will report the first control-change or note
message it receives:

[source,clojure]
----
; -> {:command :control-change, :channel 0, :note 32, :velocity 127,
;     :device {:name "SLIDER/KNOB",
;              :description "nanoKONTROL2 SLIDER/KNOB"}}
----

____
Notice that even for control changes, the controller number is
identified as `:note` (32 in this example).
____

If nothing is received for ten seconds, it will give up:

[source,clojure]
----
; -> nil
----

If this happens, remember that you need to have all of your MIDI devices
hooked up before you start Afterglow, because of limitations in the Java
MIDI implementation. Try quitting and restarting Afterglow. If that
doesn’t help, you will need to troubleshoot your MIDI setup.

NOTE: These examples show how to perform low-level MIDI mapping. Over
time, you might find that someone has written a rich user interface
binding for your controller, as is happening for the
<<mapping_sync#using-ableton-push,Ableton Push>>, which would let you
jump right in without having to worry about such details. These
examples can still help explain how your controller's binding works,
or encourage you to write and share a binding for a new controller
that you happen to have.

== Syncing to MIDI Clock

Many DJ mixers automatically send MIDI clock pulses to help synchronize
to their BPM. Pioneer’s Nexus mixers send MIDI clock over both their
physical MIDI connection, and over USB if you are connected that way,
conveniently. But they offer far more useful sync information over the
Ethernet port via Pro DJ Link packets, which Afterglow
<<syncing-to-pro-dj-link,can also process>>.

If you are using a mixer or DJ software like Traktor which supports only
MIDI clock sync, it is a lot better than nothing! Here is how to take
advantage of it.

TIP: Native Instruments has an informative Knowledge Base article
which
http://www.native-instruments.com/en/support/knowledge-base/show/750/how-to-send-a-midi-clock-sync-signal-in-traktor/[explains]
how to configure Traktor to send the MIDI clock pulses that Afterglow
can sync to. Also see
<<mapping_sync#syncing-to-traktor-beat-phase,below>> for how to sync
to the actual beat phase information when you are using Traktor.

Once you have your MIDI clock pulses reaching the system on which
Afterglow is running, start Afterglow. Because of limitations inherent
in the Java MIDI API, only MIDI devices which were connected when the
program started are available to it. Then, assuming you have only one
device sending MIDI clock, you can just execute:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/sync-to-external-clock (afterglow.midi/sync-to-midi-clock))
----

If there is ambiguity about which device’s MIDI clocks you want to
process, Afterglow will complain. Resolve that by passing a substring
which uniquely matches the name or description of the MIDI device that
you want to sync to:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/sync-to-external-clock
  (afterglow.midi/sync-to-midi-clock "traktor"))
----

NOTE: This section describes the low-level mechanisms available for
establishing MIDI sync from code and the REPL. A much easier way is to
just click the Sync button in the Metronome section at the bottom of
the <<README#the-embedded-web-interface,embedded Web interface>>.

From then on, as the BPM of that device changes, Afterglow will track it
automatically. To check on the sync status, you can invoke:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/sync-status)
; -> {:type :midi, :status "Running, clock pulse buffer is full."}
----

The calculated BPM of the synced show can be displayed like this:

[source,clojure]
----
(metro-bpm (:metronome sample-show))
; -> 128.5046728971963
----

It will bounce up and down near the actual BPM as clock pulses are
received, but overall track the beat quite well. To get a rock-solid
beat lock you need to have equipment that can provide Pro DJ Link
syncing, as described below.

To shut down the syncing, just call `sync-to-external-clock` with no
sync source:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/sync-to-external-clock)
(show/sync-status)
; -> {:type :manual}
----

== Syncing to Traktor Beat Phase

If you are using Traktor as your source of MIDI clock synchronization,
even though you cannot quite attain the kind of smoothly precise BPM
lock as you can with <<mapping_sync#syncing-to-pro-dj-link,Pro DJ
Link>>, you can configure Traktor to send its beat phase information
in a way that Afterglow can detect and analyze, giving you the same
kind of beat grid synchronization.

In order to do that, download and unzip the Afterglow Traktor
Controller Mapping,
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brunchboy/afterglow/master/doc/assets/Afterglow.tsi.zip[Afterglow.tsi],
and import it into Traktor.

WARNING: Be sure to use the following steps to import the mapping,
which will add it to any other mappings or settings you have already
set up in Traktor. If you instead use the obvious and tempting
`Import` button at the bottom of the Preferences window, you will
replace--rather than add to--your settings.

1. Open the Traktor Preferences.

2. Choose the `Controller Manager` section from the menu down the right.

3. Click the `Add...` button in the `Device Setup` section at the top:
+
image::assets/TraktorAddMapping.png[Traktor Add Device Mapping]

4. Choose `Import TSI` in the menu which pops up, and `Import
Other...` at the bottom of the menu which that opens:
+
image::assets/TraktorImport.png[Traktor Import Other TSI]

5. Navigate to the folder containing the `Afterglow.tsi` file you
downloaded, and open it.

Following this procedure will create a Device named `Clock,
Afterglow` within the Traktor Controller Manager:

image::assets/TraktorMapping.png[Afterglow Traktor Device Mapping]

Select and use that rather than the Generic MIDI device you would
create in the process described in the Traktor Knowledge Base article
linked above, and in addition to sending basic MIDI clock mesages,
Traktor will send special MIDI messages that Afterglow will recognize
and use to remain synchronized to the Traktor beat grid.

[WARNING]
====================================================================
In order to avoid extra MIDI clock pulses being sent, which will cause
the BPM calculations to be wildly incorrect, make sure not to create
more than one Generic MIDI device on the Traktor Virtual Output port.
If you created one following the directions in the Syncing to MIDI
Clock section above, be sure to delete it, and leave only the
Afterglow Traktor controller mapping.

You must still follow the instructions in the Traktor
http://www.native-instruments.com/en/support/knowledge-base/show/750/how-to-send-a-midi-clock-sync-signal-in-traktor/[Knowledge
Base article], starting with step 3.2, to ensure that the `Clock,
Afterglow` device is configured to send MIDI messages to the
appropriate MIDI output port, and step 4, which configures Traktor to
send MIDI clock.
====================================================================

The way the Afterglow mapping works is that it sends out Control
Change messages for all currently playing decks. These messages
communicate the current beat phase on that deck. (Deck A is sent as
controller `1`, B as controller `2`, C as controller `3`, and D as
controller `4`). In order for Afterglow to know which deck to pay
attention to if more than one is playing at the same time, whenever a
different deck becomes the Tempo Master, a message identifying the new
Master deck is sent out as a Control Change message on controller `0`.
(The same number to deck correspondence is used.) When no deck is
Tempo Master, a Control Change with value `0` is sent on controller
`0`.

Whenever Afterglow detects a coordinated stream of messages on
controllers `0` through `4` which are consistent with beat-phase
information from this Traktor mapping, it offers that MIDI input
device as a source of Traktor beat-phase synchronization, and if it is
synchronizing a metronome with the MIDI clock messages on that port,
will also synchronize the beats.

== Syncing to Pro DJ Link

If you are working with Pioneer club gear, such as the Nexus line of
CDJs and mixers, you can use Pro DJ Link to sync much more precisely.
You just need to be on the same LAN as the gear (most easily by
connecting an Ethernet cable between your laptop running Afterglow and
the mixer, or a hub or router connected to the mixer. You don’t need to
be connected to the Internet, the protocol works fine over self-assigned
IP addresses. You just need to specify which device you want to use as
the source of beat information, and that will generally be the mixer,
since it will track whichever device is currently the tempo master (or
perform BPM analysis if a non-DJ-Link, or even non-digital, source is
being played). Like with MIDI sync, you can give a unique substring of
the device name in the sync call:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/sync-to-external-clock
  (afterglow.dj-link/sync-to-dj-link "DJM-2000"))
----

As with MIDI, you can check on the sync status:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/sync-status)
; -> {:type :dj-link, :status "Running, 5 beats received."}
; -> {:type :dj-link,
;     :status "Network problems? No DJ Link packets received."}
----

TIP: If you are not getting any packets, you will need to put on your
network troubleshooting hat, and figure out why UDP broadcast packets
to port 50001 from the mixer are not making it to the machine running
Afterglow.

== Sending MIDI Over a Network

You can sync MIDI clock and respond to MIDI controller messages from
hardware and software which is not directly attached to the machine
running Afterglow. If you are on a Mac, this capability is built in,
and can be configured using the
https://help.apple.com/audiomidisetup/mac/10.10/index.html?localePath=en.lproj#/ams1012[Audio
MIDI Setup] utility (in the `Utilities` subfolder of your
`Applications` folder). For Windows, you can install the excellent,
free, and fully compatible
http://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/rtpmidi.html[rtpMIDI] driver.
Either of these approaches allow you to communicate with the network
MIDI capabilities built in to iOS devices and applications.

If you are interested in using Open Sound Control (OSC) control
surfaces with Afterglow, you should also check out the free
http://hexler.net/software/touchosc[TouchOSC] package (also available
for http://hexler.net/software/touchosc-android[Android]). The TouchOSC
site also has a nice
http://hexler.net/docs/touchosc-setup-coremidi-network[illustrated
walk-through] of setting up network MIDI communication.

== Checking your Sync

An easy way to see how well your show is syncing the beat is to use the
`metronome-effect`, which flashes a bright pink pulse on the down beat, and a
less bright yellow pulse on all other beats of the show metronome. To
set that up:

[source,clojure]
----
(require 'afterglow.effects.fun)
(show/add-effect! :color
  (afterglow.effects.fun/metronome-effect (show/all-fixtures)))
----

Then you can reset the metronome by hitting kbd:[Return] on the following
command, right on the down beat of a track playing through your
synchronized gear, and watch how Afterglow tracks tempo changes made by
the DJ from then on:

[source,clojure]
----
(metro-start (:metronome sample-show) 1)
----

When running live light shows you will almost certainly want to map a
button on a MIDI controller to perform this beat resynchronization
(although it is not necessary when you are using Pro DJ Link to
synchronize with your mixer—but even then you will likely want the next
two functions mapped, for realigning on bars and phrases). Here is how I
do it for one of the buttons on my Korg nanoKontrol 2:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/add-midi-control-metronome-reset-mapping "slider" 0 45)
----

Then, whenever I press that button, the metronome is started at beat 1,
bar 1, phrase 1.

You can add mappings to reset metronomes which are stored in show
variables by adding the variable name as an additional parameter at the
end of this function call. And there is a corresponding
`remove-midi-control-metronome-mapping` function to break the binding.

As noted above, even when you have a rock solid beat sync with your
mixer, you sometimes want to adjust when bars or phrases begin,
especially when tricky mixing has been taking place. You can accomplish
this by mapping other buttons with
`add-midi-control-metronome-align-bar-mapping` and
`add-midi-control-metronome-align-phrase-mapping`. These cause the MIDI
control to call `metro-bar-start` and `metro-phrase-start` on the
associated metronome to restart the current bar or phrase on the nearest
beat, without moving the beat. This means you do not need to be as
precise in your timing with these functions, so you can stay beat-locked
with your synch mechanism, much like the “beat jump” feature in modern
DJ software.

If the metronome flashes start driving you crazy, you can switch back to
a static cue,

[source,clojure]
----
(show/add-effect! :color blue-effect)
----

or even black things out:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/clear-effects!)
----

== Using Ableton Push

Some controllers have such rich capabilities that they deserve their
own custom mapping implementations to exploit their capabilities as a
show control interface. The Ableton Push is one, and a powerful
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.controllers.ableton-push.html[mapping]
is being created. You can already use it to do most of the things that
you would use the <<README#the-embedded-web-interface,web interface>>
for, and often with deeper control, since you can press multiple cue
trigger pads at the same time, and they respond to variations in
pressure.

Assuming you had an Ableton Push connected to the machine running
Afterglow when it was started up, you can activate the Push mapping
and attach it to the current default show like this:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[afterglow.controllers.ableton-push :as push])
(def controller (push/bind-to-show *show*))
----

You will see a brief startup animation, and Afterglow's Push interface
will start. Here is an overview:

image::assets/PushNoEffects.jpg[Push interface]

=== Show Control

Once you have the push linked to a show, it becomes a very intuitive
way to monitor and control the cues and other aspects of the show.

The text area at the top of the Push displays the effects currently
running, and can optionally display
<<mapping_sync#metronome-control,metronome>> information as well. If a
cue was defined with adjustable parameters for its effect, they will
also be displayed in the text area, and you will be able to
<<mapping_sync#effect-control,adjust>> them by turning the encoder
above the parameter.

The rightmost encoder, past the text area, adjusts the show Grand
Master, which controls the maximum brightness that any dimmer cue can
achieve, so you can always use it to adjust the overall brightness of
the show. As soon as you touch the encoder, the current Grand Master
level will appear, and be updated as you turn the encoder. When you
release it, the display returns to showing whatever it was before.

image::assets/GrandMaster.jpg[Grand Master adjustment]

The red `Stop` button to the right of the top of the cue grid can be
used to temporarily shut down the show, blacking out all universes
that it controls.

image::assets/ShowStop.jpg[Show stopped]

Pressing it again restarts the show where it would
have been had it not stopped.

=== Cues

Most of the space on the interface is dedicated to an 8&times;8 grid
of color coded cue trigger pads, which provide a window onto the
show's overall <<cues#cues,cue grid>>. The Push can be
<<README#scrolling-and-linked-controllers,linked>> to the
<<README#the-embedded-web-interface,web interface>> so that both
always display the same section of the cue grid, and the web interface
can remind you of the names of the cues you are looking at, or it can
be scrolled independently, allowing you access to more cues at the
same time.

You can activate any cue shown by pressing its pad; running cues will
light up, and darken again when they end. The effects which cues
create will also appear in the text area above the cue pad, from left
to right, with the most recent effect on the right. In the photo
below, &ldquo;Sparkle&rdquo; is the most recent effect, and it has two
parameters, `chance` and `Fade`, which can be adjusted by turning the
encoders above them. The `chance` value is changing rapidly because it
is configured to also be adjusted through the pressure sensitive cue
pad that was used to launch it.

image::assets/SparklePressure.jpg[Sparkle effect, ajusting chance variable]

To stop a running cue, press its pad again, or press the red `End` pad
underneath its effect entry in the text area. Some cues will end
immediately, others will continue to run until they reach what they
feel is an appropriate stopping point. While they are in the process
of ending, the cue pad will blink, and the `End` pad will be labeled
`Ending`. If you want the cue to end immediately even though it would
otherwise run for a while longer, you can press the blinking cue pad
(or effect `Ending` pad) again and it will be killed right then.

The colors assigned to cue pads by the creator of the cue grid are
intended to help identify related cues. Some cues (especially intense
ones like strobes) are configured to run only as long as they are held
down. In that case, when you press cue pad, it lights up with a
whitened version of the cue color as a hint that this is happening,
and as soon as you release the pad, the cue will end. If you want to
override this behavior, you can hold down the `Shift` button
(towards the bottom right of the Push) as you press the cue pad, and
it will activate as a normal cue, staying on until you press it a
second time.

As noted above, cues can also be configured to take advantage of the
pressure sensitivity of the Push cue pads, so that as you vary the
pressure with which you are holding down the pad, some visible
parameter of the cue is altered. The strobe and sparkle cues in
created by
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.examples.html#var-make-cues[afterglow.examples/make-cues]
for the sample show work this way: the intensity and lightness of the
strobe are increased by pressure, and so is the chance that a sparkle
will be assigned to a light on each frame. You can see these
parameters change in the text area above the cue's effect name while
you are adjusting them, as shown in the photo above.

[[exclusivity]]Cues may be mutually exclusive by nature, and if they
were created to reflect this (by using the same keyword to register
their effects with the show), when you activate one, the other cues
which use the same keyword are dimmed. This is a hint that when you
activate one of them, it will _replace_ the others, rather than
running at the same time. In the photo
<<mapping_sync#gobo-photo,below>>, the rest of the Torrent 1 fixed
gobo cues (the leftmost blue cues) are dimmed because they would
replace the running &ldquo;T1 atom shake&rdquo; cue.

=== Scrolling

The show will likely have many more cues than fit on the pad grid; the
diamond of arrow buttons at the bottom right allow you to page through
the larger show grid. If there are more cues available in a given
direction, that arrow will be lit, otherwise it is dark. Pressing an
active arrow scrolls the view one &ldquo;page&rdquo; in that
direction. In the photo below, it is currently possible to scroll up
and to the right:

image:assets/PushScroll.jpg[Push scroll diamond,300,337]

If you hold down the `Shift` button, the arrows gain a different
purpose, allowing you to scroll the text display left and right, to
see and <<mapping_sync#effect-control,adjust>> all of the currently
running effects, even though only four at a time (or three, if the
<<mapping_sync#metronome-control,metronome section>> is showing) fit
in the display. Pressing the left or right arrows scrolls the next
group of effects in that direction into view; pressing the up arrow
scrolls to the oldest (leftmost) effect, and pressing the down arrow
scrolls to the most recent (rightmost) effect. While `Shift` is
pressed, the arrows will light up according to whether they can scroll
effects rather than cues in the corresponding direction.

=== Effect Control

As described above, the effects created by cues appear in the text
display area, and can be scrolled through and ended by pressing the
corresponding red `End` pad which appears underneath them. If they
have parameters assigned to them, the parameter names and values will
appear above the effect name, and they can be adjusted using the
encoder knob above the parameter. For example, in addition to varying
the sparkle `chance` parameter using the pad pressure, as was done
above, its `Fade` parameter can be adjusted using the effect parameter
encoder above it. As soon as you touch the encode knob associated with
a parameter, a graphical representation of the current value replaces
its name, and updates as you turn the encoder to change the value.

image::assets/AdjustingFade.jpg[Adjusting Fade parameter]

If an effect has only one adjustable parameter, it will take up the
entire effect area, and you can use either encoder to adjust it, as
when adjusting a Focus <<cues#creating-function-cues,function cue>>
for the Torrent moving head spot:

[[gobo-photo]]
image::assets/AdjustingFocus.jpg[Adjusting Focus cue]

When you release the encoder knob, the adjustment graph disappears,
and the parameter name reappears.

The <- indicator at the left of the text area in the above photo is an
indicator that there are older effects which have been scrolled to the
left, off the display. You will see -> at the bottom right of the
display when there are newer effects to the right. You can scroll to
them using the `Shift` button with the scroll arrow buttons as
described <<mapping_sync#scrolling,above>>.

This photo also illustrates the dimming of incompatible cues discussed
<<mapping_sync#exclusivity,above>>: The leftmost columns of blue cues
all establish settings for the fixed gobo wheel of one of the Torrent
moving-head spots. Since one of them is active (the &ldquo;T1 atom
shake&rdquo; effect at the left of the text area corresponds to the
bright blue button three rows down the second column), the others are
dimmed to hint that pressing them would replace the active cue.

This dimming can also be seen in the web interface view of the cue grid:

image::assets/GoboCues.png[Gobo cues]

=== Metronome Control

The top left section of the Push lets you view and adjust the
Metronome that the show is using to keep time with the music that is
being played. Since Afterglow's effects are generally defined with
respect to the metronome, it is important to keep it synchronized with
the music. When active, the metronome section takes over the leftmost
quarter of the text area (so there are room to see only three effects,
rather than the normal four). To toggle the metronome section, press
the `Metronome` button. It will appear if it was not showing, and
disappear if it was there. The `Metronome` button is lit more brightly
when the section is active.

The metronome section shows the current speed, in Beats Per Minute, of
the metronome, and the `Tap Tempo` button label flashes at each beat
(this flashing happens regardless of whether the metronome section is
visible in the text area). The metronome section also shows you the
current phrase number, the bar within that phrase, and the beat within
that bar which has been reached.

image:assets/PushMetronome.jpg[Metronome section]

The most basic way of synchronizing the metronome is to tap the `Tap
Tempo` button at each beat of the music. After a few taps, the
metronome will be approximately synchronized to the music. You can
also adjust the BPM by turning the BPM encoder, which is the
rightmost encoder below the Metronome button:

image:assets/PushBPM.jpg[BPM encoder]

While you are holding this encoder, the symbol &uparrow; appears below
the BPM value as a visual reminder of what value you are adjusting.
Turning the encoder clockwise raises the BPM, turning counterclockwise
lowers it. While the metronome section is showing, you can also use
the encoder above the BPM value to adjust it. But you can grab the
dedicated BPM encoder below the `Metronome` button even when the
metronome section is not showing, and it will appear while you have
the encoder in your hand, so you can adjust the BPM quickly, and then
get back to what you were doing.

If you press the `Shift` button, the BPM encoder can be used to adjust
the BPM by whole beats rather than tenths. While `Shift` is down, the
&uparrow; will point to the left of the decimal point rather than to
the right of it, and the BPM will change ten times as quickly as you
turn it. You can switch back and forth in the middle of your
adjustments by pressing and releasing the shift key at any time.

In order to make longer chases and effects line up properly with the
music, you will also want to make sure the count is right, that the
beat number shows `1` on the down beat, and that the bar numbers are
right as well, so that the start of a phrase is reflected as bar
number `1`. You can adjust those with the beat encoder, the leftmost
encoder below the metronome button:

While you are holding this encoder, the symbol &uparrow; appears below
the beat number as a visual reminder of what value you are adjusting.
Turning the encoder clockwise jumps to the next beat, turning
counterclockwise jumps back to the previous one. As a tactile reminder
that you are adjusting whole beats, this encoder moves with a distinct
click as it changes value, while the BPM encoder turns smoothly as you
scroll through fractional BPM values.

While the metronome section is showing, you can also use the encoder
above the Beat value to adjust it. But you can grab the dedicated Beat
encoder below the `Metronome` button even when the metronome section
is not showing, and it will appear while you have the encoder in your
hand, so you can adjust the beat number quickly, and then get back to
what you were doing.

If you press the `Shift` button, the Beat encoder can be used to
adjust the current bar within the phrase instead of the current beat.
While `Shift` is down, the &uparrow; will point at the bar instead of
the beat, and turning the encoder will jump that value forwards or
backwards:

If you know a phrase is about to begin, you can press the red Reset
pad in the metronome section right as it does. This will reset the
count to Phrase 1, Bar 1, Beat 1.

Trying to keep up with tempo changes during dynamic shows can be very
difficult, so you will hopefully be able to take advantage of
Afterglow's metronome synchronization features. If the DJ can send you
<<mapping_sync#syncing-to-midi-clock,MIDI clock pulses>>, or you can
connect via a Local Area Network to Pioneer professional DJ gear to
lock into the beat grid established by
<<mapping_sync#syncing-to-pro-dj-link,Pro DJ Link>>, Afterglow can
keep the BPM (with MIDI) and even the beats (with Pro DJ Link)
synchronized for you. The Sync pad in the Metronome section (showing
`Manual` sync in these photos) will eventually allow you to set this
up, but that is not yet implemented, so for now you will need to use
the <<README#metronome-control,web interface>> to configure it.

NOTE: The pad does already change color to let you know the sync
status: amber means manual, green means successful automatic sync, and
red means a requested automatic sync has failed. It is likely that the
second release of Afterglow will let you press this pad to choose your
sync source.

Once your sync is established, the meaning of the `Tap Tempo` button
changes. If you are using MIDI clock to sync the BPM, it becomes a
`Tap Beat` button, which simply establishes where the beat falls. If
you are locked in to a Pro DJ Link beat grid, it becomes a `Tap Bar`
button which, when pressed, indicates that the current beat is the
down beat (start) of a bar. (Similarly, if you press the metronome
Reset pad while synced to a Pro DJ Link beat grid, the beat itself
will not move, but the beat closest to when you pressed the pad will
be identified as Beat 1.)

If you try to adjust the BPM encoder while sync is active, it will
have no effect, and Afterglow will highlight the sync mode to explain
why it is ignoring your adjustments.

NOTE: Future releases will also take advantage of more of the buttons
on the controller, as well as the nice big touch strip to the left of
the cue grid.
